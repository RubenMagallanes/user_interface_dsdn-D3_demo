# user_interface_dsdn-D3_demo

This is a simple application to demonstrate an understand of the D3 javascript library.
The task was to design an interface for a simple app that would be suitable for an "Optical head-mounted display", similar to Google's "Google Glass" project. The requirements included a simple interface that required only very basic controls- for example in the situation a user can only interect with their device with only swipe gestures. 
This Demo was implemented as an html page, becasue this allowed me to utilize the D3 javascript library, which is used to visualise data.
